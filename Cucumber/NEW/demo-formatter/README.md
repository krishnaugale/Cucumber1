# Cucumber Demo Formatter

This is a very simple implementation of a dtandalone Cucumber formatter. It reads messages generated by Cucumber's `message` formatter from `STDIN` and writes a report to `STDOUT`.

If you are writing a new formatter, copy this code as a starting point.

## Usage

You'll need a `messages.ndjson` file with messages that your formatter can process.
The simplest way to generate one of these is to use Cucumber's built-in `message` formatter.

### Ruby

```
cat messages.ndjson | ruby/bin/cucumber-demo-formatter
```
